## Installing Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv):

    pipenv install
    pipenv install --dev

## Using the Genetic Algorithm
For an example of how to use the genetic algorithm, see `phrase_solver.ipynb` where it is used to generate a specific sentence from random characters.

## Testing
This library uses Pytest for the unit tests.
These tests are located in the `tests` directory.
To run the tests:

    pipenv run test

## Formatting, Type Checking and Linting
This library uses a number of tools for code formatting and linting. These tools are configured in `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg` and `mypy.ini`.

Black is used as a code formatter:

    black .

isort is used for tidying up imports:

    isort .

Mypy is used as a type checker:

    mypy .

Flake8 is used for linting:

    flake8
