class Member:
    """
    This class creates a member of a population which has a chromosome of a
    specified length. The genes in the chromosome are chosen from the provided
    possible genes. The members can mix their chromosomes via crossover and
    there is a random chance for the genes to mutate during this process,
    controlled by the mutation rate.

    Different simulations will have chromosomes of different types depending on
    the goal. Chromosome creation and crossover will need to be adjusted to suit
    the given task. The fitness function will also need to be changed.
